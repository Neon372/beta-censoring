That being said, some of these are more intensive than others to actually apply to an image. In particular, black bar will generally be the fastest while stickers will generally be the slowest with most of the others between those two. In particular, if you&#39;re noticing the <em>censoring time</em> increasing but not the <em>inference time</em> then you may want to consider using less intensive censoring types.</p><h3 id="image-size" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#image-size" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Image Size</h3><p>As you&#39;d expect, the larger an image the harder it is to both detect matches and censor those matches. Beta Censoring will always scale large images down for the AI (to improve performance) but will then apply censoring to the full-size image and return the censored images at full resolution. This improves quality but does slow the server down when censoring very large images.</p><p>If you&#39;re seeing significant performance degradation with large images, raise an issue on GitHub and we will look into methods to improve this.</p><h3 id="experimental-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#experimental-features" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Experimental Features</h3><p>Some of the features exposed by Beta Censoring are <em>experimental</em> features that we have included for those who want to use them but may impact performance.</p><h4 id="facial-feature-detection" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#facial-feature-detection" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Facial Feature Detection</h4><p>Facial feature detection uses its own model and middleware to identify specific facial features when faces are detected.
